# IGLA — Formal results, measured propositions, and where they sit in the literature

**Status:** living document · **Established:** Wave Loop 585, 2026-08-09 · **Issue:** [#1959](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/issues/1959)
**Anchor:** φ² + φ⁻² = 3 | TRINITY

This document separates three things that are easy to conflate:

1. **Theorems** — machine-checked, with the proof script in the repository.
2. **Measured propositions** — empirical claims with a stated method, a number,
   and a falsification condition.
3. **Context** — what is already known in the literature, and which of the
   above is novel against it.

Nothing here is asserted without one of those three labels.

---

## 1. Theorems (machine-checked)

All three are proved by [`yosys`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) over the
shipped RTL. The scripts are in [`fpga/formal/`](../../fpga/formal/) and are
re-run every wave; the results below are from W585.

### T1 — Exact equivalence of the multiplier-free ternary MAC

> For **all** 8-bit signed activations `a`, **all** 2-bit weight codes `w_code`
> and **all** 32-bit signed accumulator inputs `acc_in`, the shipped RTL
> `ternary_mac_top` produces exactly the same `acc_out` as a golden model that
> uses a real `*` operator.

**Method.** A sequential miter over the two designs, `-seq 2` (reset plus one
enabled accumulate step), discharged by SAT.
**Script.** [`prove_ternary_mac.ys`](../../fpga/formal/prove_ternary_mac.ys).
**Status.** `SAT proof finished — no model found`, i.e. no distinguishing input
exists.

**A caveat established in W574 that matters for anyone citing this.** `yosys
miter -equiv` pairs ports **by name**, not by position. T1 therefore says what
the circuit *computes*; it says nothing about the order arguments should be
given in any language binding. W573 briefly treated the golden model's port
order as normative and W574 withdrew that.

### T2 — Zero DSP48 usage

> The multiplier-free implementation synthesises to **zero** DSP48 primitives on
> `xc7`, where the golden model using `*` synthesises to one.

**Method.** `synth_xilinx -abc9 -nocarry -arch xc7` on both designs, comparing
the cell census.
**Script.** [`prove_no_multiplier.ys`](../../fpga/formal/prove_no_multiplier.ys).

T2 is what makes T1 interesting: equivalence alone would be unremarkable if both
designs used a multiplier.

### T3 — Unbounded accumulator invariant by temporal induction

> The demo core's accumulator stays within its declared range for **all** input
> sequences, not merely for bounded traces.

**Method.** Temporal induction (`-tempinduct`), which discharges the property for
traces of unbounded length rather than up to a depth bound.
**Script.** [`prove_demo_core.ys`](../../fpga/formal/prove_demo_core.ys).

### What is deliberately *not* claimed

- No theorem about the **t27 compiler**. Every compiler change in this chain is
  gated empirically (§2), not proved.
- No theorem about the **synthesised bitstream** beyond T1–T3. The 150.63 MHz
  timing closure is a tool report, not a proof.
- No claim that the RTL is *optimal* — only that it is equivalent and
  multiplier-free.

## 2. Measured propositions

Each carries a method, a number, and what would falsify it. Where a proposition
has been **withdrawn**, that is recorded rather than deleted.

### P1 — Multiplier-free ternary MAC costs 120 LUT / 60 FF at 150.63 MHz

**Method.** openXC7 place-and-route on XC7A200T-FGG676, 0 errors.
**Falsified by.** A routed design on the same part with a different cell count,
or a timing report contradicting the 150.63 MHz figure.
**Status.** Standing since W553. Never executed on hardware — see §4.

### P2 — 65.3% of the corpus's test blocks asserted nothing (W555)

**Method.** Static scan of 14,996 test blocks.
**Now.** 14.4% after the W559 lowering, and the current generated output carries
**9,267 real assertions** across 397 parsing specs.
**Falsified by.** A count of `@panic("assertion failed")` in generated Zig that
does not match.

### P3 — Silent truncation: 32 specs were being read at a fraction of their length

**Method.** `parse_ast_strict` — parse, then require the token stream reached
`Eof` (`t27c parse-complete`).
**Numbers.** 29 specs truncated by a stray `}` (W569, 16,792 lines); 3 more by a
struct method or a second `module` header (W577, 2,438 lines).
**Now.** Zero. The parser reports the error instead.
**Falsified by.** `t27c parse-complete` reporting a non-zero `TRUNCATE` count.

### P4 — The lexer silently discarded `?`, changing meaning rather than losing code

**Method.** `t27c lex-dropped`, which records every character the
unknown-character arm discards.
**Number.** 287 occurrences of `?`. `?u64` reached the backend as `u64` — an
optional silently became a non-optional, with no diagnostic anywhere.
**Distinguishing feature.** Every other silent discard found in this chain *lost*
code; this one *changed what the code said*.
**Now.** `?` is a token; 1,135 characters still dropped, all Markdown punctuation
in mis-named files or non-ASCII bytes.

### P5 — Nobody had ever compiled the C backend's output

**Method.** `t27c cc-gate` — `cc -fsyntax-only` over every generated header.
**First measurement (W583).** 36 of 397 compiled.
**Now.** 101 of 397. The remaining 296 are attributed by class.
**Why it survived.** Every gate in this project measures the Zig path, because
something runs it. Rust, C and Verilog shared one gate: *does `gen-<backend>`
exit zero* — and emitting `[]u8 field;` exits zero.

### P6 — The `default_input()` wall was not the blocker (W585)

This is the substantive finding of W585 and it reverses a conclusion this chain
carried from W560 to W584.

**The claim carried since W560.** 169 specs call `default_input()`, a helper
defined nowhere; it is the largest blocker in three measurement systems at once
(47 of 216 Zig compile failures, 75 of 296 C header failures, 29 of 32
`check-calls` findings).

**The resolution.** The helper is not derivable from its own call — it takes no
arguments and returns whatever the next line needs. But the next line is
`f(input)`, and `f`'s parameter type is *declared*. The binding's type is
therefore recoverable from its **use**, and the tests constrain the value not at
all (their assertion is `result != undefined`, which is trivially true). Lowering
the binding to a typed placeholder removes the helper entirely: `default_input`
as a first error went **109 → 0**.

**What was behind it.**

| | |
|---|---:|
| Specs carrying `// TODO: Implement from .tri spec` | **169** |
| Functions with an **empty body** across them | **571** |
| Template tests calling the scaffold | 765 |

**571 empty functions and 571 template tests.** One generated test per
unimplemented function. The scaffold generated a test for every function it also
left unimplemented, and the missing helper had been standing in front of that
fact for twenty-five waves.

**Conclusion.** `default_input()` was never a blocker in the sense the project
believed. It was a *mask*. The blocker is that 571 declared functions have no
implementation — which is a specification-completeness fact, not a compiler
defect, and no amount of backend work can change it.

**Falsified by.** A count of `TODO: Implement from` that does not match the count
of empty function bodies, or a spec in that set whose functions do have bodies.

## 3. Where this sits in the literature

Stated from general knowledge of the field, without fabricated citations. Where a
work is named, it is named because it is well known and its content is being
described accurately, not because a specific edition or page has been consulted.

### Balanced ternary

Balanced ternary — digits {−1, 0, +1} — is old and well characterised; Knuth's
*The Art of Computer Programming* Vol. 2 gives the standard treatment, including
its self-complementing negation and the absence of a sign bit. **Nothing in this
project's ternary arithmetic is novel against that**; what is specific here is
the FPGA lowering (T1/T2) and the claim that the multiply degenerates to a
conditional sign-flip, which is a direct consequence of the digit set and not a
new result.

### Ternary and low-bit neural networks

The line from BinaryConnect and XNOR-Net through ternary weight networks to
**BitNet b1.58** (Microsoft Research, 2024) establishes the practical claim IGLA
depends on: weights constrained to {−1, 0, +1} remove the multiplier from the
inner loop, replacing it with add/subtract/skip. BitNet b1.58's contribution was
showing this at LLM scale with competitive perplexity. **T1 and T2 are the
hardware-side restatement of that claim for one specific MAC**, machine-checked
rather than benchmarked — which is a different kind of evidence, not a stronger
one.

### CORDIC

`specs/igla/race/cordic*.t27` implement Volder's CORDIC (1959) — rotation by a
sequence of arctangent-table steps, with the characteristic gain
∏√(1 + 2^(−2i)) ≈ 1.6468, whose reciprocal ≈ 0.6073 is exactly what
`cordic_fixed_gain_q15` asserts. **The spec's own test agrees with the classical
constant**, which is a small but real cross-check that the implementation is the
algorithm it claims to be.

### Systolic arrays

`systolic_ternary.t27` and `systolic_array.t27` are weight-stationary systolic
processing elements in the sense of Kung and Leiserson (1978), and the same
structure modern accelerators use. W571 refused to write `systolic_ternary_array`
because the spec's own tests contradict each other on whether the output length
follows the input size — a question the literature does not settle, because it is
about *this* spec's intent.

### What is genuinely novel here

Not the arithmetic, and not the architecture. What this repository has that the
literature does not is the **spec-first pipeline itself** — a single `.t27`
source lowered to Zig, Rust, C and Verilog, with the RTL then machine-checked
against a golden model. The interesting question it raises is empirical and is
answered in §2: *what actually survives that pipeline?* Twenty-five waves of
measurement say the answer was, for a long time, much less than the project
believed — and that every gap was invisible for the same reason, which §4 states.

## 4. The conclusion this chain actually supports

Eighteen waves of findings share one shape:

| Wave | The component | What it discarded, silently |
|---|---|---|
| W559 | parser | 7,623 test bodies |
| W569 | parser | 16,792 lines behind a stray `}` |
| W572 | parser | the receiver of `f(x).len()`, 198 sites |
| W577 | parser | 2,438 lines, two further mechanisms |
| W581 | **lexer** | `?`, 287 sites — *changing meaning, not losing code* |
| W582/583 | **C backend** | 409 invalid declarations nobody compiled |
| W585 | — | the `default_input` mask over 571 empty functions |

**Every one is a component that accepted input, produced a smaller or different
program, and reported success.** Not one was found by a test failing. Each was
found by asking a component to state what it does — a completeness check, a
conformance table, a compiler run — and comparing that to what it actually did.

The practical rule, and the one result here that generalises past this
repository:

> **A stage that cannot fail cannot be trusted. Ask each stage to account for
> its input — did it consume all of it, does it agree with a written-down table,
> does a real compiler accept its output — because a stage that silently
> discards will report success forever.**

The FPGA track is the counter-example that proves the point: it has been
correct since W553 precisely because `yosys` and `nextpnr` are consumers that
refuse to accept nonsense. It is the only part of this project that was never
wrong, and the only part with a real consumer.

## 5. Open questions, with the artefact that would settle each

| Question | Deciding artefact |
|---|---|
| `ternary_mac`'s argument order — 91 call sites say `(acc, a, w)`, 80 say `(a, w, acc)`, *inside the module that declares it* | not the RTL (T1 binds by name, W574). A host-side driver or ISA document, neither of which exists |
| `systolic_ternary_array`'s output length — an invariant says `len == size`, a test says `len == 0` for size 2 | the systolic RTL in `fpga/verilog/` |
| `OP_ADD` / `OP_SUB` — asserted to pass `is_sacred_opcode`, but the sacred set is eleven named opcodes | the ISA encoding table under `specs/isa/` |
| 15 Markdown documents named `*.t27` — 7% of everything failing to parse, no fix possible | a rename-or-exclude decision; changes provenance (`MANIFEST.json`, 104 references) |
| **571 functions with no implementation** | the `.tri` sources these specs were generated from, if they exist |
