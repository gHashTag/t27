# FORMAL_FOUNDATIONS.md — propositions, measurements, and what they do not prove

> **Standing rule for this file:** every numbered proposition states its

## 1. Propositions established in the 2026-08-09 audit campaign

### Proposition 1 — the seal path function is injective on this corpus, and not in general

Let `Σ` be the map from spec path to seal path implemented by `seal_file_path`:

```
Σ(p) = ".trinity/seals/" ++ replace(strip_suffix(strip_prefix(p, "specs/"), ".t27"), '/', '_') ++ ".json"
```

**1a. `Σ` is injective on the current corpus.** `MEASURED`.
Enumerating all 496 specs under `specs/` yields **496 distinct images**.
Reproduce:

```bash
for f in $(find specs -name '*.t27'); do ./target/release/t27c seal-path "$f"; done | sort -u | wc -l   # 496
```

**1b. `Σ` is not injective on all path sets.** `PROVED` (counterexample).
Because `_` is a legal character inside a path component, flattening `/` to `_`
cannot be injective. Witness:

```
Σ("specs/a_b/c.t27") = .trinity/seals/a_b_c.json
Σ("specs/a/b_c.t27") = .trinity/seals/a_b_c.json
```

Pinned by `seal_path_tests::flattening_is_not_injective_in_general`, which
asserts the collision **holds** — so if the encoding is ever changed, that test
fails and forces this document to be revisited.

**1c. The residual risk is contained at write time, not by the encoding.**
`seal --save` refuses to write a seal whose recorded `spec_path` differs from
the spec being sealed. A future collision therefore surfaces as a loud error
rather than silent data loss. This is the substantive lesson: **a partial
invariant plus a guard at the mutation site is stronger than a total invariant
nobody re-checks.** The predecessor scheme `<parent-dir>_<module-name>` had no
guard, and its collision (`feed_forward.t27` and `feed_forward_network.t27`,
both declaring `module FeedForward;`) silently destroyed one seal and left that
spec unverifiable for months.

**Corollary 1d.** `Σ` requires no parse and no compile — it is a pure function
of the path string. This is why the pre-commit hook can resolve a seal location
without building the compiler, and why two independent derivations of the same
path (a bash `basename` guess and the compiler's rule) collapsed into one.

### Proposition 2 — the open-source Yosys frontend cannot consume concurrent SVA

`MEASURED` on Yosys 0.63 (`70a11c6`, macOS arm64).

The `--with-sva` bundle advertises formal-friendliness. Measured support:

| Construct | Example | Yosys `read_verilog -sv -formal` |
|---|---|---|
| Named property block | `property p; @(posedge clk) a \|-> b; endproperty` | **rejected** — `syntax error, unexpected TOK_PROPERTY` |
| Inline concurrent assertion | `assert property (@(posedge clk) a \|-> b);` | **rejected** — `syntax error, unexpected '@'` |
| Immediate assertion in `always` | `always @(posedge clk) assert (!a \|\| b);` | **accepted** |

**Consequence 2a.** Since SymbiYosys uses Yosys as its frontend, the emitted
SVA could never have been checked by the open-source formal flow — with or
without the file-scope bug fixed in this campaign. A `.sby` harness over these
files would have failed at parse. Consuming this SVA requires `sv2v`
preprocessing or a Verific-enabled Yosys, neither of which is in this repo.

**Consequence 2b.** The file-scope defect was real and independent: SystemVerilog
forbids `property` outside a module/interface/checker, and the emitter wrote it
bare. That is now fixed (properties are wrapped in a `bind`-able
`module behavior_sva_v2` whose ports are the referenced signals), which is
necessary for any conformant tool — but **not sufficient for Yosys**, per 2a.

**Consequence 2c.** The bundle contains exactly **one** assertion in synthesised
RTL (`multilayer_sequencer.sv`); the rest live in the separate property file.
"Formal-friendly" describes the emitter's intent, not a checked property of the
design.

### Proposition 3 — a verified formal-proof pipeline using only Yosys

`MEASURED`. No SymbiYosys required. For immediate assertions (Prop 2), this
sequence both **proves** true properties and **refutes** false ones:

```
read_verilog -sv -formal <file>
prep -top <top>
async2sync                 # $check cells are edge-triggered; lowering needs this first
chformal -lower            # modern Yosys emits $check; legacy `sat` cannot model it
sat -verify -prove-asserts -seq <N> -tempinduct
```

Validated in both directions, which is the part that matters — a pipeline that
only ever reports success is indistinguishable from one that checks nothing:

- true property → exit **0**
- false property → exit **1**, `Called with -verify and proof did fail!`

Omitting `async2sync` gives `Cannot lower edge triggered $check cell`; omitting
`chformal -lower` gives `No SAT model available for cell $check`. Both were
encountered and are recorded here so the next attempt does not rediscover them.

---

### Proposition 4 — conformance payload classification

`MEASURED`. Of 101 files in `conformance/`: **88** carry vectors, **5** are
measured reports, **8** are schema definitions, **0** are empty. The prior
validator reported "43 valid, 58 empty" because it resolved payloads with
`.as_array()` only, while the corpus stores vectors both as arrays and as
objects. **A count is a claim about a predicate, and the predicate was wrong.**

## 3. Conclusions

1. **Every quality gate audited in this campaign enforced something weaker than
   its name**, and three enforced nothing at all (`echo` statements). The
   generalisable check is cheap: for each gate, write down the property its name
   claims, then read it and write down the property it tests. The gap is the
   defect. It requires no domain knowledge and found six real ones here.

2. **Presence is not integrity.** 730 seal files existed and 0 verified. Both
   the local gate (`[[ -f ]]`) and the CI job (an echo) measured presence. The
   distinction is not pedantic: it was the difference between a four-month-stale
   provenance chain and a sound one.

3. **A clean 0% or 100% is a harness fault until disproved.** Twice this
   campaign a uniform result was an artefact — `FAIL: 496` meant *binary not
   found*, `58 empty/skipped` meant *object-shaped*. Once it was real
   (`seal 0/496`). The discipline of checking costs a minute; not checking cost
   a wrong plan that would have fabricated test vectors for 45 files that
   already had them.

4. **A single outlier after a uniform operation is signal.** 495/496 after a
   mass re-seal was not noise — it was a non-injective path function destroying
   one seal.

5. **Regenerating a measurement is repair; rewriting a baseline is a decision.**
   The coverage file was regenerated without asking. The seal re-baseline waited
   for the maintainer, because it canonicalises whatever the current codegen
   emits and no independent oracle says that output is right.

6. **Evidence citing a command that does not exist is not weak evidence — it is
   not evidence.** `clara_spec_coverage.json` recorded a passing run of
   `bash scripts/clara/demo.sh`, a path absent from the repository, for four
   months. Run an evidence file's own reproduction command before reading its
   numbers.

## 4. Open questions

- **Is a ternary-weight datapath still the right target** given arXiv:2504.18415
  moving the constraint to activation width? This is a design question the
  repo has not addressed in writing.
- **Can the `--with-sva` output be checked at all in the open-source flow?**
  Prop 2 says not without `sv2v` or Verific. Evaluating `sv2v` is the smallest
  next experiment.
- **Per-file vector *sufficiency* is unmeasured.** Prop 4 counts files carrying
  vectors; it says nothing about whether those vectors exercise anything.
- **Compiler correctness is unproved and unclaimed.** `bootstrap/` is
  unverified Rust. Vericert is the mature alternative if that property is
  wanted.
