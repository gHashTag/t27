## 1. Propositions established in the 2026-08-09 audit campaign

### Proposition 1 — the seal path function is injective on this corpus, and not in general

Let `Σ` be the map from spec path to seal path implemented by `seal_file_path`:

```
Σ(p) = ".trinity/seals/" ++ replace(strip_suffix(strip_prefix(p, "specs/"), ".t27"), '/', '_') ++ ".json"
```

**1a. `Σ` is injective on the current corpus.** `MEASURED`.
Enumerating all 496 specs under `specs/` yields **496 distinct images**.
Reproduce:

```bash
for f in $(find specs -name '*.t27'); do ./target/release/t27c seal-path "$f"; done | sort -u | wc -l   # 496
```

**1b. `Σ` is not injective on all path sets.** `PROVED` (counterexample).
Because `_` is a legal character inside a path component, flattening `/` to `_`
cannot be injective. Witness:

```
Σ("specs/a_b/c.t27") = .trinity/seals/a_b_c.json
Σ("specs/a/b_c.t27") = .trinity/seals/a_b_c.json
```

Pinned by `seal_path_tests::flattening_is_not_injective_in_general`, which
asserts the collision **holds** — so if the encoding is ever changed, that test
fails and forces this document to be revisited.

**1c. The residual risk is contained at write time, not by the encoding.**
`seal --save` refuses to write a seal whose recorded `spec_path` differs from
the spec being sealed. A future collision therefore surfaces as a loud error
rather than silent data loss. This is the substantive lesson: **a partial
invariant plus a guard at the mutation site is stronger than a total invariant
nobody re-checks.** The predecessor scheme `<parent-dir>_<module-name>` had no
guard, and its collision (`feed_forward.t27` and `feed_forward_network.t27`,
both declaring `module FeedForward;`) silently destroyed one seal and left that
spec unverifiable for months.

**Corollary 1d.** `Σ` requires no parse and no compile — it is a pure function
of the path string. This is why the pre-commit hook can resolve a seal location
without building the compiler, and why two independent derivations of the same
path (a bash `basename` guess and the compiler's rule) collapsed into one.

### Proposition 2 — the open-source Yosys frontend cannot consume concurrent SVA

`MEASURED` on Yosys 0.63 (`70a11c6`, macOS arm64).

The `--with-sva` bundle advertises formal-friendliness. Measured support:

| Construct | Example | Yosys `read_verilog -sv -formal` |
|---|---|---|
| Named property block | `property p; @(posedge clk) a \|-> b; endproperty` | **rejected** — `syntax error, unexpected TOK_PROPERTY` |
| Inline concurrent assertion | `assert property (@(posedge clk) a \|-> b);` | **rejected** — `syntax error, unexpected '@'` |
| Immediate assertion in `always` | `always @(posedge clk) assert (!a \|\| b);` | **accepted** |

**Consequence 2a.** Since SymbiYosys uses Yosys as its frontend, the emitted
SVA could never have been checked by the open-source formal flow — with or
without the file-scope bug fixed in this campaign. A `.sby` harness over these
files would have failed at parse. Consuming this SVA would require a Verific-enabled Yosys; **`sv2v` does not
work for this — see Prop 5, it deletes assertions.** The constructive route is
Prop 6: emit the subset Yosys accepts.

**Consequence 2b.** The file-scope defect was real and independent: SystemVerilog
forbids `property` outside a module/interface/checker, and the emitter wrote it
bare. That is now fixed (properties are wrapped in a `bind`-able
`module behavior_sva_v2` whose ports are the referenced signals), which is
necessary for any conformant tool — but **not sufficient for Yosys**, per 2a.

**Consequence 2c.** The bundle contains exactly **one** assertion in synthesised
RTL (`multilayer_sequencer.sv`); the rest live in the separate property file.
"Formal-friendly" describes the emitter's intent, not a checked property of the
design.

---

### Proposition 3 — a verified formal-proof pipeline using only Yosys

`MEASURED`. No SymbiYosys required. For immediate assertions (Prop 2), this
sequence both **proves** true properties and **refutes** false ones:

```
read_verilog -sv -formal <file>
prep -top <top>
async2sync                 # $check cells are edge-triggered; lowering needs this first
chformal -lower            # modern Yosys emits $check; legacy `sat` cannot model it
sat -verify -prove-asserts -seq <N> -tempinduct
```

Validated in both directions, which is the part that matters — a pipeline that
only ever reports success is indistinguishable from one that checks nothing:

- true property → exit **0**
- false property → exit **1**, `Called with -verify and proof did fail!`

Omitting `async2sync` gives `Cannot lower edge triggered $check cell`; omitting
`chformal -lower` gives `No SAT model available for cell $check`. Both were
encountered and are recorded here so the next attempt does not rediscover them.

---

### Proposition 4 — conformance payload classification

`MEASURED`. Of 101 files in `conformance/`: **88** carry vectors, **5** are
measured reports, **8** are schema definitions, **0** are empty. The prior
validator reported "43 valid, 58 empty" because it resolved payloads with
`.as_array()` only, while the corpus stores vectors both as arrays and as
objects. **A count is a claim about a predicate, and the predicate was wrong.**

---

### Proposition 5 — `sv2v` cannot rescue the SVA: it deletes it

`MEASURED` on sv2v 0.0.13.

The obvious repair for Prop 2 is to preprocess SystemVerilog into Verilog-2005
with [sv2v](https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v) before handing it to Yosys. It does
not work, and the failure mode is the dangerous kind.

sv2v's own README states: *"Assertions are also supported, but are simply
dropped during conversion."* Confirmed directly — input a module containing a
`property` block and an `assert property`, and the output contains **zero**
assertions:

```
$ sv2v sva_in.sv > sva_out.v ; echo $?
0
$ grep -c assert sva_out.v
0
```

**5a. The exit code is 0 and there is no warning.** A pipeline
`sv2v → yosys → sby` would therefore run to completion, report success, and
prove **nothing** — there would be no properties left to violate. This is
strictly worse than the current state, where the flow fails loudly at parse.

**5b.** sv2v also does not support the `bind` keyword, which is the mechanism
the module-wrapped SVA of Prop 2b relies on.

**Conclusion.** sv2v is not a path to a checkable SVA flow here. A green formal
run over an empty property set is the CI-theater failure of Conclusion 1
wearing a real tool's name.

---

### Proposition 6 — the property set *is* checkable, in the immediate-assertion subset

`MEASURED`. Rather than translate the emitted form, emit the form Yosys accepts.
`t27c gen-behavior-sva-yosys` produces immediate assertions:

| Behavior form | Immediate translation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `a \|-> b` | `assert (!(a) \|\| (b))` | translated |
| `a \|-> ##N b` | `assert (!($past(a, N)) \|\| (b))` | translated |
| `a \|-> s_eventually b` | — | **not expressible**; reported, not dropped |

**6a. Yosys reads it and the assertions survive into the netlist.**
`read_verilog -sv -formal` exits 0 (the `property` form does not), and
`stat` reports **2 `$check` cells** for a two-assertion module — the contrast
with Prop 5 that matters: the properties are still there to be violated.

**6b. The prover actively refutes.** Run over free inputs, the pipeline of
Prop 3 returns `Called with -verify and proof did fail!`, because
`running && !full` is reachable. An engine that reports success on an
unconstrained module would be evidence of nothing.

**6c. The liveness gap is reported, not hidden.** `s_eventually` has no
immediate form — an immediate assertion evaluates in a single cycle. Those
behaviors are listed on stderr and in a `NOT TRANSLATED` comment inside the
generated file, so the artefact states its own coverage. Emitting a silently
smaller property set would repeat Conclusion 1: a gate going green over a
domain nobody was told had shrunk.

**6d. Guard correctness.** The delayed form guards on `rst_n && $past(rst_n)`,
not `rst_n` alone. Guarding on the current cycle only lets the assertion fire
one cycle after reset, when the antecedent's history predates the reset. The
prover produced that counterexample during development and was right.

---

### Proposition 7 — a lost-interrupt race in `interrupt_controller`, found and fixed by proof

`PROVED` (machine-checked, Yosys 0.63). **This is the first real hardware defect
this campaign's formal work has found, and it was found by the prover, not by
reading.**

The emitted RTL latched three interrupt sources and cleared on read as four
independent non-blocking assignments:

```verilog
if (inference_done) irq_status[0] <= 1'b1;
if (dma_done)       irq_status[1] <= 1'b1;
if (error)          irq_status[2] <= 1'b1;
if (status_read)    irq_status     <= 3'b000;  // Clear on read
```

Non-blocking assignments in one `always` block resolve last-write-wins, so a
`status_read` concurrent with an event **discards that event**.

**7a. The refutation is discriminating.** Two properties differing only by the
guard `!$past(status_read)`:

| Property | Before fix |
|---|---|
| `$past(inference_done) && !$past(status_read) \|-> irq_status[0]` | **PROVED** |
| `$past(inference_done) \|-> irq_status[0]` | **REFUTED** |

The difference isolates the cause to the concurrent read exactly.

**7b. The mechanism was then confirmed positively**, which is stronger than a
counterexample. This holds on every reachable state:

```
$past(inference_done) && $past(status_read) |-> irq_status[0] == 0     PROVED
```

Not "the event can be lost" — the event **is always** lost. A host servicing an
interrupt would silently drop any event arriving in the same cycle as its status
read, the classic read-clear race, in a completion-signalling path.

**7c. The fix**: apply the clear to the *previous* value and OR this cycle's
sources on top, so clear-on-read survives without being able to discard a
simultaneous event.

```verilog
irq_status <= (status_read ? 3'b000 : irq_status)
            | {error, dma_done, inference_done};
```

**7d. All six properties now prove**, including clear-on-read
(`a_read_clears`) — the fix does not trade one behaviour for another. The
harness is checked in at `formal/interrupt_controller_props.sv` and validated
in both directions: it proves against the fixed RTL and **refutes against the
old RTL**, so it is a regression witness rather than a decoration.

**7e. Two unit tests had pinned the bug in place.** `each_source_latches_its_bit`
and `status_read_clears_latch` asserted the *literal text* of the buggy chain.
They passed for exactly as long as the race existed and would have failed the
moment it was fixed. **A test that asserts the shape of an implementation
cannot notice that the implementation is wrong.** Both now assert reachable
behaviour, with the formal harness carrying the real proof.

---

### Proposition 8 — `axi_lite_slave` accepted more transactions than it could answer

`PROVED` (machine-checked). Second real defect found by pointing the prover at
generated RTL, and the second one a passing unit test had been holding in place.

`s_axi_awready`, `s_axi_wready` and `s_axi_arready` were asserted at reset and
**never deasserted**. The module has a single `bvalid`/`bresp` register and a
single `rvalid`/`rdata` register, so it can owe at most one response per
channel. Accepting a second transaction while the first response is
unacknowledged merges two transactions into one response beat, and an AXI
master waits forever for the beat that never comes.

**8a. Formalised as a transaction balance**, which is stronger than a
handshake-shape check:

```verilog
outstanding_w <= outstanding_w + (awvalid && wvalid && awready && wready)
                                - (bvalid && bready);
assert (outstanding_w <= 1);
```

| Property | Old RTL | Fixed RTL |
|---|---|---|
| `a_one_outstanding_write` | **REFUTED** | PROVED |
| `a_one_outstanding_read` | **REFUTED** | PROVED |
| `a_no_write_accept_while_pending` | **REFUTED** | PROVED |
| `a_bvalid_stable` / `a_rvalid_stable` | PROVED | PROVED |
| `a_sanity` (tautology) | PROVED | PROVED |

Both channels had the identical defect. AXI VALID-stability was never violated —
the bug is not that responses are malformed, it is that there are **too few of
them**.

**8b. The fix** releases `ready` only on the response handshake and drops it on
accept, bounding each channel to one outstanding transaction. It costs one cycle
of throughput per transaction and is what the single-register design implies.

**8c. One refutation was an artifact, and separating it mattered.**
`bresp == 2'b00` came back REFUTED under `-tempinduct`, even though `bresp` is
only ever assigned `2'b00`. Temporal induction may begin in an **unreachable**
state where `bresp` holds garbage. Re-run from a reachable start
(`-set-init-zero`) it **PROVES**.

```
tempinduct (unconstrained init) -> REFUTED     # artifact
BMC from zero-init state        -> PROVED      # truth
```

The two genuine defects were refuted under **both** settings. **A refutation is
only evidence of a bug if the counterexample state is reachable** — otherwise it
is evidence about the proof method. Cross-checking every refutation against a
reachable start is the cheap discriminator, and it is what kept a false bug
report out of this document.

**8d. `a_sanity` is a deliberate tautology** carried in the harness. A property
that cannot fail, failing, means the run is not evaluating what it appears to —
the `-flatten` trap from Prop 7 surfaces exactly that way.

---

### Proposition 9 — two AXI4 master defects in `dma_controller`

`PROVED` (machine-checked). Third module checked, two more real defects, and
the fourth and fifth passing unit tests found holding a bug in place.

**9a. Burst abandonment.** `m_axi_arlen` and `m_axi_awlen` were hardwired to
`8'hFF` — 256 beats — for *every* transfer, while the FSM left `READ_DATA`
once `bytes_remaining` fell to one beat. A short transfer therefore requested
256 beats and then dropped `rready` mid-burst. **An AXI4 master may not abandon
a burst it requested.**

```
a_read_burst_not_abandoned      old: REFUTED      fixed: PROVED
```

Fixed by deriving the burst length from the bytes still owed
(`ceil(bytes/8)`, capped at 256, encoded as beats-1) and leaving `READ_DATA`
only on `rlast`, chaining another burst from an advanced address when bytes
remain. The write path had the mirror defect: `wlast` was raised when the
*transfer* ended rather than when the announced *burst* did.

**9b. Ready without valid.** `READ_ADDR` advanced on `if (m_axi_arready)`
alone. A `ready` asserted while `arvalid` was still low moved the FSM into
`READ_DATA` **having issued no address** — the master then sat ready for a
burst nobody owed it. `WRITE_ADDR` had the same shape.

```
a_rready_implies_burst          old: REFUTED      fixed: PROVED
```

Note that AXI VALID-stability (`a_arvalid_stable` and friends) **proved on the
broken design**. The defect is not a malformed handshake; it is a *missing*
one. Those properties are kept in the harness to bound what the bug was not.

**9c. Two candidate findings were rejected**, and rejecting them mattered as
much as the fixes:

| Candidate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `zero_length_moves_nothing` | **Not a bug.** Proved on the pre-fix RTL from a reachable state. The guard added alongside the real fixes is hardening, not a repair, and is recorded as such. |
| `beats_taken <= ceil(length/8)` | **Inconclusive, not claimed.** With `rvalid` a free input, a misbehaving slave is indistinguishable from a master defect. It refuted even after the fixes, and a faithful enough slave model to settle it was not built. Recorded as an open question rather than a finding. |

**9d. Environment assumptions are part of the claim.** The `a_rready_implies_burst`
property is meaningful only with a minimal slave model (`assume (!rvalid ||
burst_active)`). Stating a master-side property without constraining the slave
proves nothing about the master. Every `assume` in a harness narrows what the
`assert` means, and the narrowing belongs in the write-up.

---

### Proposition 10 — a reusable AXI4 slave model, and one anomaly left open

`MEASURED` for 10a. **10b is deliberately left unresolved**, and saying so is
the point of this entry.

**10a. The model, and why its precondition is asserted not assumed.**
`formal/axi4_read_slave_model.sv` constrains a read slave to what AXI4 actually
requires: no unsolicited beats, `rlast` exactly on the (`arlen`+1)-th beat, and
slave-side VALID stability. It does **not** constrain `arready`, which a slave
may stall freely.

The model tracks one burst at a time, which is faithful only if the master
issues one at a time. That is checked by `a_model_precondition_single_burst`
rather than assumed. **Assuming it would let the model hide exactly the class
of defect it exists to expose**, and the distinction was not academic: the
precondition initially **refuted**. Port-only properties
(`!(arvalid && rready)`, no back-to-back AR handshakes) both **proved** on the
same RTL, which located the fault in the *model* — it cleared `burst_active`
from its own beat counter instead of from the master-visible `rlast`, so a
single disagreement latched it high forever. Keyed off `rlast`, the
precondition proves.

The sequence is the reusable part: **when a model's precondition fails, check
the same claim with properties that use only the ports of the unit under test.
If those hold, the model is wrong.**

**10b. Open anomaly — `arlen` at the address handshake.** With `length`
constrained to 8 (a single-beat transfer, so `arlen` must be 0):

```
assert (!(arvalid && arready) || arlen == 8'd0)     REFUTED
```

Hand-tracing the RTL says this should hold: `m_axi_arlen <= burst_len` and
`m_axi_arvalid <= 1'b1` are assigned on the same cycle in `READ_ADDR`, from a
`bytes_remaining` that the IDLE branch commits in the same non-blocking group
as the state change.

**The refutation and the hand-trace disagree, and this entry does not claim
which is right.** It is recorded as an anomaly, not a defect and not an
artifact. Consequently the over-read property
(`beats_taken <= ceil(length/8)`) also remains **open** — it refutes, but a
harness that produces one unexplained result cannot be trusted to settle a
second.

The alternative was to pick the reading that made a tidier story. Two waves ago
an unreachable-state refutation was nearly filed as a bug (Prop. 8c); the cost
of a false finding is that someone acts on it. **An anomaly with a name and a
reproduction is more useful than a confident answer that might be wrong.**

Reproduce:

```bash
yosys -p "read_verilog -sv -formal <bundle>/dma_controller.sv \
          formal/axi4_read_slave_model.sv <harness>; \
          prep -top chk -flatten; async2sync; chformal -lower; \
          sat -verify -prove-asserts -seq 16 -set-init-zero"
```

---

### Proposition 11 — the anomaly was the harness, and the cause was an opt-in flag

`PROVED`. Prop. 10 closed with `arlen == 0` refuting at the address handshake
while a hand-trace said it must hold, recorded as an unexplained anomaly.
It is now explained, and the explanation generalises past this repository.

**11a. Yosys's `sat` ignores `$assume` cells unless `-set-assumes` is passed.**
It is opt-in and silent. A harness without the flag still runs, still prints
`PROVED` or `REFUTED`, and every `assume` in it is inert — so a property meant
to hold *given a compliant environment* is being checked against an arbitrary
one. Demonstrated with a two-line module: `assume (1'b0)` alongside
`assert (a == !a)`.

```
without -set-assumes -> REFUTED   (the false assertion is reachable)
with    -set-assumes -> PROVED    (vacuously, as an unsatisfiable assumption requires)
```

**11b. That fully accounts for the anomaly.** With the flag, a readable
counterexample became available (single module, no `-flatten`, so signal names
survive). The trace shows the environment driving `m_axi_rvalid` **without ever
asserting `rlast`**: `bytes_remaining` walks 8 → 0 → −8 → −24, `beats_owed`
becomes enormous, and `burst_len` saturates to `8'hFF`. The 256-beat request
was real, and it required a **non-compliant slave**.

**11c. Under a compliant slave the property holds.** Re-run with the AXI4
contract active — no unsolicited beats, `rlast` exactly on the last beat of the
burst:

```
a_arlen_zero      PROVED
a_no_underflow    PROVED
```

So: **not a defect.** The design is correct against the protocol contract, and
the earlier refutation was a harness that had never applied its own constraints.

**11d. Audit of everything that came before.** All three checked-in harnesses
were re-run with and without the flag. All prove **both ways**, so the four RTL
defects of Props. 7–9 are unaffected — those properties never depended on an
assumption. Only the inconclusive Prop. 10 investigation was affected, and it
is now resolved.

**11e. A defensive clamp was written, then reverted.** Forcing
`beats_burst >= 1` would stop the `beats_owed == 0` wrap. But 11c *proves*
that state unreachable under contract, and the non-compliant case underflows to
a **large** `bytes_remaining`, where `arlen = 255` is arithmetically correct
rather than a wrap — so the clamp fixed nothing reachable while adding a branch.
Full immunity to a lawless slave is not available anyway: the only way to stop
consuming early is to abandon the burst, which is itself the violation fixed in
Prop. 9a. **Proving code unreachable is a reason to delete it, not to add it.**

**11f. The flow now verifies itself.** `formal/assume_liveness_check.sv` is
proved first in CI; it passes only when assumptions are live. This is the
tautology instrument of Prop. 7 turned on the tool instead of the design — the
recurring shape being that a checker which cannot fail, and a checker whose
constraints do nothing, are the same defect wearing different clothes.

---

### Proposition 12 — the 21 properties are non-vacuous, and the check is now permanent

`MEASURED`. Prop. 11 found constraints that did nothing. Vacuity is its mirror:
a property that **passes because the interesting case never happens**. Neither
appears as a failure; both make a green run worthless.

Two levels were checked.

**12a. Guard reachability.** For each `G |-> P`, the assertion body was replaced
with `assert (1'b0)` under the same guard. That run **proves iff `G` is
unreachable** — a precise vacuity oracle needing no `cover` support. All other
assertions in the file were neutralised to `assert (1'b1)` so each result speaks
about one guard only.

```
19 properties checked      reachable 19      vacuous 0
```

*(19 rather than 21: two `a_sanity` tautologies are deliberately unconditional
and have no guard to reach.)*

**12b. Interesting-case reachability.** Guard reachability is necessary, not
sufficient: `assert (!A || B)` is trivially satisfied whenever `A` is false, so
a property can be evaluated constantly and still test nothing. Six cases that
the properties exist to cover were probed by asserting their negation — a
**refutation is the witness** that the case occurs:

| Case | Property it gives teeth to | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `irq_enable == 0 && irq_status != 0` | `a_mask_suppresses` | REACHABLE |
| `inference_done && status_read` | `a_event_never_lost` | REACHABLE |
| `outstanding_w == 1` | `a_one_outstanding_write` | REACHABLE |
| `bvalid && !bready` | `a_no_write_accept_while_pending` | REACHABLE |
| `rvalid && rready && !rlast` (multi-beat burst) | `a_read_burst_not_abandoned` | REACHABLE |
| a burst active at all | `a_rready_implies_burst` | REACHABLE |

The fifth matters most: `a_read_burst_not_abandoned` is the regression witness
for Prop. 9a, and on single-beat bursts alone it would be vacuous. It is not.

**12c. Made permanent.** `formal/witnesses.sv` carries these as standalone
harnesses; CI runs each **expecting refutation**. A witness that starts proving
means the case became unreachable and the property guarding it is now free.

The pair of gates now reads: `$check`-cell counts prove the properties **exist**
(Prop. 6), witnesses prove they **bite**. Together with Prop. 11's
assumption-liveness check, the flow now verifies three distinct ways of passing
while testing nothing — **which is the same defect the whole campaign began with,
found once in a shell gate, once in a CI `echo`, and now twice inside the prover
itself.**

---

### Proposition 13 — two zero-count non-terminations, in a family where two siblings guard

`PROVED`. Fourth and fifth modules checked, fifth and sixth real defects. Both
are the same shape, and the shape is now a pattern worth naming.

**13a. `layer_sequencer` with `num_neurons == 0`.** The terminator is
`neuron_id == num_neurons - 1`, which compares against `16'hFFFF` when the count
is zero. It never matches, so the sequencer emits `valid` for neuron indices
0, 1, 2, … indefinitely.

**13b. `weight_prefetch_ctrl` with `num_words == 0`.** `words_remaining`
underflows to `16'hFFFF` on the first beat and `words_remaining == 1` never
matches, so the controller writes BRAM indefinitely — past the 4096-entry
buffer and past anything the caller asked for.

**13c. Stated as bounds, not as liveness.** Non-termination is a liveness
property and an immediate assertion cannot express it (Prop. 6). Both were
instead written as safety bounds that the runaway violates:

```
valid   |-> neuron_id < num_neurons        REFUTED -> PROVED
writes  <= num_words   (while active)      REFUTED -> PROVED
```

**A runaway loop usually has a safety shadow** — some counter or index that
leaves its legitimate range — and the shadow is checkable where the liveness
property is not.

**13d. The discriminating evidence was already in the module.**
`a_chunk_in_range` **proved on the same RTL that refuted `a_neuron_in_range`**:
`layer_sequencer` already contained `if (num_chunks == 0) state <= DONE_ST` and
had simply not done the same for neurons. `multilayer_sequencer` guards
`num_layers > 0`. `dma_controller` gained its `length != 0` guard in Prop. 9.
**Two siblings in the family guard the zero case and two did not** — which
settles the reading as oversight rather than a deliberate contract, without
needing to ask anyone.

**13e. Isolation.** Assuming the count non-zero, both properties prove. The
refutations are precisely the zero case and nothing else.

**13f. A ninth text-pinning test.** `prefetch_fsm_states_present` asserted
`IDLE: if (start_prefetch) begin` — the unguarded form. Every RTL defect found
in this campaign, now six of six, had a passing unit test holding it in place.

## 3. Conclusions

1. **Every quality gate audited in this campaign enforced something weaker than
   its name**, and three enforced nothing at all (`echo` statements). The
   generalisable check is cheap: for each gate, write down the property its name
   claims, then read it and write down the property it tests. The gap is the
   defect. It requires no domain knowledge and found six real ones here.

2. **Presence is not integrity.** 730 seal files existed and 0 verified. Both
   the local gate (`[[ -f ]]`) and the CI job (an echo) measured presence. The
   distinction is not pedantic: it was the difference between a four-month-stale
   provenance chain and a sound one.

3. **A clean 0% or 100% is a harness fault until disproved.** Twice this
   campaign a uniform result was an artefact — `FAIL: 496` meant *binary not
   found*, `58 empty/skipped` meant *object-shaped*. Once it was real
   (`seal 0/496`). The discipline of checking costs a minute; not checking cost
   a wrong plan that would have fabricated test vectors for 45 files that
   already had them.

4. **A single outlier after a uniform operation is signal.** 495/496 after a
   mass re-seal was not noise — it was a non-injective path function destroying
   one seal.

5. **Regenerating a measurement is repair; rewriting a baseline is a decision.**
   The coverage file was regenerated without asking. The seal re-baseline waited
   for the maintainer, because it canonicalises whatever the current codegen
   emits and no independent oracle says that output is right.

6. **Evidence citing a command that does not exist is not weak evidence — it is
   not evidence.** `clara_spec_coverage.json` recorded a passing run of
   `bash scripts/clara/demo.sh`, a path absent from the repository, for four
   months. Run an evidence file's own reproduction command before reading its
   numbers.

## 4. Open questions

- **Is a ternary-weight datapath still the right target** given arXiv:2504.18415
  moving the constraint to activation width? This is a design question the
  repo has not addressed in writing.
- **Can the `--with-sva` output be checked at all in the open-source flow?**
  Prop 2 says not without `sv2v` or Verific. Evaluating `sv2v` is the smallest
  next experiment.
- **Per-file vector *sufficiency* is unmeasured.** Prop 4 counts files carrying
  vectors; it says nothing about whether those vectors exercise anything.
- **Compiler correctness is unproved and unclaimed.** `bootstrap/` is
  unverified Rust. Vericert is the mature alternative if that property is
  wanted.
